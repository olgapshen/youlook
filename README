source DB/schema.sql;

Create user for own the schema (choose user name and password).

CREATE USER 'youlook'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '123456';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON youlook.* TO 'youlook'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Create configuration directory with configuration file:

sudo mkdir -p /opt/youlook

Create file config.ini inside the folder with follow configuration,
substituting user name and password with those you chose to set:

[auth]

Go back to the repository folder, locate pom.xml file and be in same directory
with the file.

Try to build, package and deploy the application:

mvn tomcat7:redeploy

(use redeploy instead of deploy, thus deploy not always works).

Open monitor for catch DB connection exceptions:

tail -f /var/log/tomcat7/catalina.out

Leave it open and see for errors.

If everything fine, navigate to follow url:

http://localhost:8080/youlook/listProcessedStrings

You will get empty set.

Now try to fill the DB:

http://localhost:8080/youlook/countDigits?str=test1string4

It will display 2, thus there are 2 digits in query string,
and write data to DB.

Check the DB again:

http://localhost:8080/youlook/listProcessedStrings

That it )
